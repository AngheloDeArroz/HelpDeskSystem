# Statement of the Problem
In many organizations, managing IT support requests and tracking reported issues is often inefficient. This leads to delays in resolution, miscommunication between staff and IT teams, and a lack of accountability. Employees frequently face difficulties in reporting technical problems, and support teams struggle to prioritize and monitor ongoing tickets due to reliance on manual or unorganized systems such as emails or spreadsheets.
As a result, downtime is prolonged, productivity decreases, and user frustration increases. The absence of a centralized, automated ticketing system also makes it challenging to generate reports, analyze recurring issues, and identify areas for improvement in IT support services.
There is a clear need for a structured helpdesk solution that allows users to submit, track, and manage support requests efficiently, while providing IT teams with tools to organize, prioritize, and resolve issues promptly.


# User Personas
- Admin
- Support
- User

# User Stories
- As a User, I want to view the tickets I created so I can stay updated if it's resolved.
- As a User, I want to create tickets so I can inform the IT support for technical issues/problems.
- As a Support Role, I want to view the tickets submitted by the users.
- As a Support Role, I want to “mark as resolved” the ticket so the users will know I resolved their technical issue/problem .
- As an Admin, I want to view all the tickets that are submitted by the users.
- As an Admin, I want to delete the tickets that are closed or not relevant, so the database will not be crowded.

# Acceptance Criteria
- As a User, I want to view the tickets I created so I can stay updated if it's resolved.
- As a Support Role, I want to “mark as resolved” the ticket so the users will know I resolved their technical issue/problem
These stories are examples of the core functionality of the system, their story is considered done once the Support marks the ticket as resolved and the user is updated with the result.
